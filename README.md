# Dotfiles | macOS themes collection

## üèì Introduction
I'm Itay, a 12 y/o kid from israel, and i love making my computer look and behave just like i want it to. These are my Dotfiles, with 2 themes. Enjoy! <br>

## üöÄ Why are my Dotfiles different than (most) others?
- 2 different themes instead of 1
- A dmenu script to easily switch between these themes
- Speaking of dmenu, my Dotfiles have 7 other dmenu scripts for you to explore and use!

cd misc/fonts

```

### Move files (By default for pacman setup)
```
# theme spacific
cd ~/Dotfiles
mv -r config/rices/Pacman/sketchybar ~/.config/sketchybar
mv -r config/rices/Pacman/yabai ~/.config/yabai
mv -r config/rices/Pacman/skhd ~/.config/skhd
mv -r config/rices/Pacman/alacritty ~/.config/alacritty
mv -r config/rices/Pacman/nvim ~/.config/nvim
mv -r config/rices/Pacman/cava ~/.config/cava

# not theme spacific
mv misc/zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
mv misc/starship/starship.toml ~/.config/starship.toml
```

### Start services
```
brew sevices start yabai
brew sevices start skhd
brew sevices start sketchybar
```
## üó≥Ô∏è Setup - Dmenu
### Install dependencies
- Install macports (the following command is for macos ventura, install manually for other versions)
```
if ! command -v port &> /dev/null
then
   brew install wget
   wget https://github.com/macports/macports-base/releases/download/v2.8.0/MacPorts-2.8.0-13-Ventura.pkg
   open MacPorts-2.8.0-13-Ventura.pkg
   echo "_________"
   echo ""
   echo "Follow the instructions on-screen to install macports"
else
   echo "macports is already installed, you're set."
fi
```
- Install dependencies for dmenu (on mac) with macports (This procces is going to take some time, **DO NOT** cancel the installation in the middle)
```
sudo port install dmenu
sudo port uninstall dmenu
# installing and then uninstalling right away might seem pointless, but this way all dependencies are installed.
```
### Install my build of dmenu
- First of all, make sure you cloned this repo to ~/Dotfiles and it is the working directory in the terminal. If you've followed the previous instructions, your'e good. If you didn't, run the following:
```
brew install koekeishiya/formulae/skhd
git clone https://github.com/itaysharir/Dotfiles ~/Dotfiles
cd Dotfiles
```
- cd into dmenu/dmenu-4.9 ```cd ~/Dotfiles/dmenu/dmenu-4.9```
- Build dmenu by running ```sudo make install```
- Reboot
- Now dmenu and the scripts are installed. If you've followed all above instructions (from "Setup - Themes" AND "Setup - Dmenu"), you should be able to hit ```cmd + shift + return``` to open the dmenu script that launches apps. See my skhd config for additional keyblindings. 
- If you didn't follow the instructions from "Setup - Themes", run the following:
```
brew install skhd
cd ~/Dotfiles/
mv -r config/rices/Pacman/skhd ~/.config/skhd
brew services start skhd
```

## üòÅ Credits
- Obviously, DT. I took HUGE insporation for the "DT's Xmonad" theme from your xmobar & xmonad configs.
- [gh0stzk](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles) I also took HUGE inspotations from your Emilia theme for my "Pacman" theme. I also completly ripped off your README.md design
